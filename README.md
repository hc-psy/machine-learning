# Machine Learning Foundations/Techniques
Implementations of some machine learning algorithms required by the two NTU courses (ML foundations/techniques) lectured by Hsuan-Tien Lin. Also, Latex-based handwritten homework is included.

## Main implementations

* Perceptron learning algorithm
* Decision Stump
* Non-linear SGD
* Regularization and cross-validation
* Support vector machine
* Random forest
* Neural network
* XGBoost

## Others
